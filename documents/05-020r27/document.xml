<script>Latn</script><abstract><p>The <link target="http://www.opengeospatial.org/">OGC</link> provides a collaborative, consensus process for developing and approving open, international standards for the geospatial domain. "International standards"<fn reference="1"><p>As defined in ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2</p></fn> are those adopted by an international standardizing/standards organization and made available to the public. Specifically, an OGC standard is:</p>
<p>A document, established by consensus and approved by the OGC Membership, that provides, for common and repeated use, rules, guidelines or characteristics for activities or their results, aimed at the achievement of the optimum degree of order in a given context.</p>
<p>To guide an open standards development and approval process, a member approved Policies and Procedures is required.</p>
<p>This document describes the OGC Technical Committee (TC) policies and procedures (P&amp;P). The TC has been granted authority to operate by the OGC Bylaws. The TC is composed of individuals representing organizations that are duly recognized members in good standing of the OGC. The Technical Committee Chair (TCC - see <xref target="role-of-the-technical-committee-chair"/>) facilitates the TC process.</p>
<p>The TC P&amp;P:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Documents all TC voting processes and procedures;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Documents the formation, scope and processes required for TC subgroup and committee activities;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Documents the processes and procedures for submitting, reviewing, and approving a new standard using the Request for Comment procedures; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Documents the process for revisions to adopted OGC&#174; standards.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As the needs and purpose of the TC change, these policies and procedures changes are approved by an electronic vote of the Voting Members of OGC TC or by recommendation of the OGC Planning Committee (PC). These policies and procedures may be augmented or clarified by Policy Directives issued and approved by the TC or the PC. Such directives are databased and hyperlinked to/from the appropriate portion of this document.</p>
<p>The OGC Technical Committee provides an open, collaborative forum for professional discussion related to the consensus development and/or evaluation, approval, and revision of OGC international standards. The primary use of approved OGC standards is to provide the ability to build and deploy interoperable geospatial solutions in the larger Information Technology (IT) domain.</p>
<p>The OGC <link target="http://www.opengeospatial.org/ogc/policies/conduct/">Principles of Conduct</link> govern personal and public interactions in any TC activity.</p></abstract>

The key consideration for a Community standard submission is that there is very strong evidence of implementation. At the same time, the community owning the standard may not want to allow normative changes (except for errors) to the document, may not wish to follow the OGC Modular Specification Policy, nor do they wish to develop CITE tests. Please visit Section 9.5 and Annex C to read more about the requirements for submitting a Community standard as well as a checklist of steps in the Community standard submission, review, and approval process.</p>

However, the members wish to approve the document as an official OGC document in order to have developers and organizations implement the draft standard and provide feedback. A draft standard is uplifted to a standard once evidence for implementation is provided. A draft standard is often derived from output of requirements discussions in DWGs, results of Innovation Program activities, and/or the OGC Technology Strategy which links key innovation activities to anticipate standards needs for emerging technologies.</p>

Strong evidence of implementation as required for the Community standard is generally defined to be implementation in multiple products or environments OR widespread use of the standard in a community, even if in only one or a limited number of products or environments. Evidence of implementation for a standard in the Full standards track is defined as three or more documented implementations that meet the Nature of implementation criteria, below. The TC may choose to override the minimum number of implementations for a specific candidate standard by specifying a lesser number in the electronic adoption vote.</p>
<p id="_32abe13d-c0a2-4d93-bc8b-cbcfc883f186">Nature of implementation: API, service, and exchange protocol standards shall have as evidence of implementation running services which deliver content to another machine (including client software).
