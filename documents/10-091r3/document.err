Some of them are already available as adopted or proposed specifications by other groups (NASA and NOAA in particular), but nearly all of them are available as part of the netCDF packages which have been implemented and used widely for decades. The CF conventions are in fact a separate entity, but they too evolved as part of the netCDF community of practice and were initially implemented for use with netCDF. By no means is this list prescriptive or comprehensive; some extensions listed here may never be written, and others not listed at this time may be added and developed later.</p>

	<p id="_b6a15595-ecea-4897-af76-c513e8079386">NcML is an XML representation of netCDF metadata, (approximately) the header information one gets from a netCDF file with the “ncdump -h” command. NcML is similar to the netCDF CDL (network Common data form Description Language), except, of course, it uses XML syntax. The simplest use of NcML is to describe the metadata and structural content of a netCDF file. A more advanced use is to modify existing NetCDF files, as well as to create “virtual” NetCDF datasets, for example through aggregation.</p>

Because of that, there have been suggestions that establishing the most commonly used APIs as a standard would greatly benefit interoperability in a wider community. Hence, they are included here as future possibilities, but are not the initial focus of the CF-netCDF SWG.</p>
