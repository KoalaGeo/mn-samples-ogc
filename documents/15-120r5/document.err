	<p id="_d5606b31-6fc8-4fd4-988a-590cab0ed8a0">The primary audience for the CDB standard includes distributed simulation system developers and synthetic environment database tool developers whose applications are intended to read and/or write synthetic environment database files. To this end, this document discusses concepts incorporated in the standard and contains a detailed description of the physical layout of the files as represented on disk.</p>

	<clause id="_problem_definition" obligation="normative"><title>Problem Definition</title><p id="_37bfeaaf-9285-4d5d-bb25-8f2cfc730222">Complex mission simulators include a wide range of subsystems designed to simulate onboard equipment and to provide a rich gaming environment complete with weather, computer generated forces, ordnance, air traffic, networked players, etc. Each of these subsystems traditionally utilizes a proprietary runtime database (and format) for its synthetic representation of the gaming area. These application-specific formats have been generated off-line at a database generation facility using a variety of tools and processes. This traditional approach to simulation has several inherent disadvantages, including length of time needed for synthetic environment production for multiple simulation applications, loss of correlation due to compilation differences, complexity in configuration management, and an inefficient update process. The abundance of distinct database formats creates several challenges for configuration management, resulting in mismatched correlations, and in the increased timeline needed to generate these databases. The CDB Standard specifies an approach that establishes conventions for all simulator client subsystems (aka simulator client-devices). Further, the CDB Best Practices provide detailed guidance on how to use a set of industry-standard formats.</p>

However, for the sake of backwards compatibility, the use of DB remains in this document.</p></fn> (DB) Generation Timeline</title><p id="_6a894980-2d8d-4576-ab44-7a7025edfbb6">Important reductions in both the DB generation and DB update timeline are expected from an implementation of the CDB standard because of the following.</p>
