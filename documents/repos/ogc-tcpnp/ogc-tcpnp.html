Specifically, an OGC standard is:</p>

Any TC member may send another representative of his or her organization as a substitute to a TC meeting (please note <a href="#proxy-for-voting">Clause 5.3.4</a>). Subgroups may only meet by being formally scheduled by the TCC or designee during the course of regularly scheduled TC meetings (subgroups cannot have alternative meetings that overlap temporally with the TC Meeting without approval of the TCC or PC).</p>

One of the primary functions of the TC is to vote on a variety of actions, items, and issues. Votes can be for any purpose pertaining to the format and content of the Abstract Specification, Candidate standards, OGC standards, Discussion Papers, approval of the slate of nominations for the OGC Architecture Board, Best Practices Documents, Policies and Procedures of the TC, and for other purposes consistent with the purpose of the TC as described in these Policies and Procedures.

If there is quorum, then a simple majority of the Voting TC Members present at a meeting shall constitute a positive vote for all TC Items and Issues.

<p id="_5bb19bcd-736f-4ed4-a3ed-7d25903c85a0">The three-week rule clause ensures that Voting TC members have adequate time to read, distribute and gather comments on documents before voting on the document at the following TC meeting.</p></div>

Also, like any other sub-group meeting of the TC, they shall announce the meeting to the broader TC and communicate an agenda.

<p id="_8b06553d-143d-45ff-b797-dc6e53c49d26">Quorum for votes on any items or issues brought before a SWG is based on the number of voting members for that SWG. Insuring quorum at SWG meetings is a vital aspect of the SWG being able to complete its work in a timely manner. Therefore, any SWG voting member who misses two consecutive SWG meetings (teleconference, face to face, or webinar) in which votes occur or misses two consecutive email votes shall be deemed as inactive and will not count toward quorum after the second missed vote. The SWG Chair shall take roll call at the beginning of each meeting and determine quorum based on active voting members only. An inactive SWG voting member can become active again simply by attending the SWG meetings and participating. If regular attendance by a given voting member is an issue, that voting member may assign a temporary or permanent proxy to another SWG voting member or to the SWG Chair. The voting member may rescind that proxy at any time. If the voting member wishes not to assign their proxy, they can ask to change their status to &#x201C;Observer&#x201D; and still actively participate in the SWG.</p></div>

<p id="_df3ebf55-620b-4ea8-a6eb-62598f787b07">Acceptance of the TC recommendation for adoption is always with the caveat that the PC may verify that the standard&#x2019;s sponsor organization(s) is/are in a position to develop (or have developed for the sponsor organization) or commercialize an implementation of the standard. Further, for candidate standards developed external to the OGC and submitted into the OGC process, the PC may verify that the submitting organization has provided a duly executed submission of technology form. In addition, the TC recommends acceptance contingent on the PC&#x2019;s finding that the sponsoring organization(s) makes the technology available as per the OGC Intellectual Property Policies and Procedures.</p>

In those cases in which backwards compatibility cannot be achieved, the SWG will insure that all inconsistencies are highlighted and documented. These will be incorporated into a Standard Revision Release set of notes that must accompany the new revision. Release notes document all enhancements, changes, and compatibility issues resulting from the revision of the interface standard. Both the TC and the PC reserve the right to review the issues related to backwards compatibility for a given revision of a standard.
